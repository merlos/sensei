# Sensei - Yet another ESP32 microcontroller app.

Sensei is a personal toy project. It is a client server app for the microcontroller ESP32. It loads the data from the sensors connected to the ESP32 and sends them to a server application.

With the collected data you get real time information and lovely time series graphs.

## Tech Stack

* The client is written in C++ for he Arduino IDE.
* The server is written in Ruby on Rails.
* The statistics and viewer is not yer written xD, but probably will use python.
